# Nuwe CaixaBankTech React Cross-Platform Challenge

This is my response to the [Nuwe & CaixaBank Tech challenge](https://nuwe.io/challenge/react-cross-platform). The objective is to build a mobile & web cross platform in React, following the [design given in Figma](<https://www.figma.com/file/QwywweWsNXzZhGQGOjw3zi/Figma-for-Developers%2C-Frontend-Masters-(Community)?node-id=41%3A331>)

We should build the components for a mobile web app and for a dashboard. So far I've been able to build the web app using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Recharts](https://recharts.org/), a React composable charting library for the graphics.
